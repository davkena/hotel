From humble beginnings in a small-town drugstore, Tower Records eventually became the heart and soul of the music world, and a powerful force in the music industry. In 1999, Tower Records made an astounding $1 billion. In 2006, the company filed for bankruptcy. What went wrong? Everyone thinks they know what killed Tower Records: The Internet. But that's not the story. Directed by Colin Hanks, and featuring music icons like Dave Grohl, Elton John and Bruce Springsteen, “All Things Must Pass” is a feature documentary film examining this iconic company's explosive trajectory, tragic demise, and legacy forged by its rebellious founder Russ Solomon.",

By the age of twenty-three he was performing his first gig in America, facing an astonished audience in his bright yellow dungarees, a star-spangled T-shirt, and boots with wings. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again.<br /><br />His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with song-writing partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with Princess Diana and Queen Elizabeth; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury, and George Michael to setting up his AIDS Foundation to conquering Broadway with <i>Aida<\/i>, <i>The Lion King<\/i>, and <i>Billy Elliot the Musical<\/i>. All the while Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for over a decade.<br /><br />In <i>Me<\/i>, Elton also writes powerfully about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father. In a voice that is warm, humble, and open, this is Elton on his music and his relationships, his passions and his mistakes. This is a story that will stay with you by a living legend."

The show has been running since September 2011 with the most recent leg being 16 shows between March 29 and April 26 2014. The concerts are the culmination of Elton John’s decades long partnership with Yamaha pianos. This film features classic Elton John tracks from across his extraordinary career performed either with his band, with percussionist Ray Cooper or solo. The multimedia staging is extraordinary with vast screens behind the stage illustrating the songs and the piano itself acting as a screen for graphics and animations. Elton John is the ultimate live showman and this is the definitive Elton John concert experience."

This unique “doc opera, ” a dizzying blend of documentary archive footage, animation and rock opera goes from the early days of Alice as the frontman for a cutting edge rock band in the sixties through the hazy decadence of global celebrity in the seventies and on to his winking comeback as the glam metal godfather in the eighties. This is the tale of Alice and Vincent battling for each other’s souls. “Super Duper Alice Cooper” combines audio interviews with a wealth of archive Alice Cooper footage covering concerts, TV appearances, movie cameos, dramatic headlines and magazine spreads. All the highlights of his career are covered aided by contributions from some of the biggest music icons of all time including Iggy Pop, Elton John, John Lydon, Bernie Taupin, Dee Snider and of course Alice Cooper himself. This is the definitive, extraordinary story of the man and the myth that is uniquely Alice Cooper."

He befriended Ryan White, a young Indiana boy ostracized because of his HIV infection. Ryan's inspiring life and devastating death led Elton to two realizations: His own life was a mess. And he had to do something to help stop the AIDS crisis. <br /><br /> Since then, Elton has dedicated himself to overcoming the plague and the stigma of AIDS. The Elton John AIDS Foundation has raised and donated $275 million to date to fighting the disease worldwide. Love Is the Cure includes stories of Elton's close friendships with Ryan White, Freddie Mercury, Princess Diana, Elizabeth Taylor, and others, and the story of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.  <br /><br /> Sales of <i>Love Is the Cure<\/i> benefit the Elton John AIDS Foundation."

The result was 1973′s sprawling “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road”, a record that mixed genres and sounds with ease and spawned hit singles such as “Bennie and the Jets”, “Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting” and “Candle in the Wind.” This episode of the CLASSIC ALBUMS series uses interviews with Sir Elton and his songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, archival footage of the demo sessions, and rare live performances to tell the story behind the canonical album."

AMERICAN MASTERS looks back to the 12-year-old girl who played tennis on public courts, observed disparity and, as she soared athletically, never stopped trying to remedy inequality. Perhaps best remembered from \"The Battle of the Sexes\" match vs. Bobby Riggs on Sept. 20, 1973, her competitiveness on the court was matched by her efforts on behalf of women and the LGBT community, and her commitment to prove there is strength in diversity. King presents her own story, with perspective from Serena and Venus Williams, Hillary Clinton, Maria Sharapova, members of the Virginia Slims Circuit \"Original 9\" including Rosie Casals, Gloria Steinem, Chris Evert, Bobby Riggs' son Larry, family, friends, and many others. Through these interviews and archival footage, the film illustrates the life of a woman whose journey became not just a battle for personal glory but a sociopolitical battle for equality for all."

Their investigation of the regulations, cultural prejudices, and child trafficking policies behind the process takes them from the slums of Ukraine, through China, and the US. They speak with prospective parents, social workers, lawyers, psychologists, and adoption agencies to find a flawed system that allows millions of orphans to languish in foster care and learn that children lack the most basic human rights."

                             "description": "<b>The true story of Elton John’s meteoric rise from obscurity to worldwide celebrity in the weird, wild 1970s, based on rare one-on-one interviews with the&#xa0;Rocket Man&#xa0;himself<b>—now the subject of a major motion picture.<\/b><\/b><br /><br /> In August 1970, Elton John achieved overnight fame with a rousing performance at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. Over the next five years, the artist formerly known as Reginald Dwight went from unheard of to unstoppable, scoring seven consecutive #1 albums and sixteen Top Ten singles in America. By the middle of the decade, he was solely responsible for 2 percent of global record sales. One in fifty albums sold in the world bore his name. Elton John’s live shows became raucous theatrical extravaganzas, attended by all the glitterati of the era.<br /><br /> But beneath the spangled bodysuits and oversized eyeglasses, Elton was a desperately shy man, conflicted about his success, his sexuality, and his narcotic indulgences. In 1975, at the height of his fame, he attempted suicide. After coming out as bisexual in a controversial <i>Rolling Stone<\/i> interview that nearly wrecked his career, and announcing his retirement from live performance in 1977 at the age of thirty, he gradually found his way back to the thing he cared about most: the music. <br /><br /> <i>Captain Fantastic<\/i> gives readers a behind-the-scenes look at the rise, fall, and return to glory of one of the world’s most mercurial performers. Rock journalist Tom Doyle’s insider account of the Rocket Man’s turbulent ascent is based on a series of one-on-one interviews in which Elton laid bare many previously unrevealed details of his early career. Here is an intimate exploration of Elton’s working relationship with songwriting partner Bernie Taupin, whose lyrics often chronicled the ups and downs of their life together in the spotlight. Through these pages pass a parade of legends whose paths crossed with Elton’s during the decade—including John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Groucho Marx, Katharine Hepburn, Princess Margaret, Elvis Presley, and an acid-damaged Brian Wilson.<br /><br /> A fascinating portrait of the artist at the apex of his celebrity,<i> Captain Fantastic<\/i> takes us on a rollicking fame-and-drug-fueled ride aboard Elton John’s rocket ship to superstardom.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>Captain Fantastic<\/i><\/b><br /><br />“Veteran rock journalist [Tom] Doyle continues his foray into the 1970s music scene with a compelling profile of an unlikely rock star. . . . In chronicling Elton John’s stratospheric rise to fame, replete with platinum records, increasingly outlandish stage shows, and mountains of cash, the author deftly manages to keep his subject in sharp focus. Based on hours of one-on-one interviews with Captain Fantastic himself, this breezy yet comprehensive biography demonstrates what it was like for the talented musician to churn out an impossible string of hit records. . . . A great way to better understand the man behind the garish glasses and platform boots.”<b>—<i>Kirkus Reviews<\/i><\/b><br /><br /> “In this adoring and candid set of fan’s notes, music journalist Doyle (<i>Man on the Run<\/i>) draws on interviews with John and his colleagues, especially his writing partner, Bernie Taupin, to capture the meteoric rise and fall of the man who released at least one album every year of the 1970s. . . . This energetic book . . . makes a convincing case that John reached his peak and made his best music in the ’70s.”<b>—<i>Publishers Weekly<\/i><\/b><br /><br /> “A breezy and surprisingly poignant romp through a decade, and a career, that effectively invented modern celebrity culture.”<b>—Peter Doggett, author of <i>You Never Give Me Your Money: The Beatles After the Breakup<\/i><\/b>"

Such shamelessness and sheer silliness rivals anything uttered by punk rockers, yet it is so typically Elton: honest and intemperate. Tragedy and heartbreak have played a large part in his life. Behind the parties, the hedonism, the lavish stage costumes, and silly glasses lies a more somber story. Between disputes with managers, legal wranglings, public break-ups, and divorce, John has been faced with not only an expanding waistline and a receding hairline, but serious health problems and drug addictions. Drawing on many firsthand interviews with his associates and musical collaborators, this intriguing story of high drama and prodigious talent traces John's astonishing journey through life as the colossus of camp, while also offering a critical history of his work and a fresh analysis of his contributions to popular music."
